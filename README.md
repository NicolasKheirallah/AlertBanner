# Alert Banner SPFx Extension

## Summary

The **Alert Banner SPFx Extension** is a custom SharePoint Framework (SPFx) extension designed to display alert notifications prominently in the Banner of Modern SharePoint sites. These alerts are dynamically retrieved from a SharePoint list using the Microsoft Graph API, ensuring users receive important updates and information seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 services.

## Goal of this Project

Alert banners are frequently requested by organizations such as IT departments but are not readily available out-of-the-box. This extension aims to provide a flexible and reusable alert system that any organization can deploy with ease.

Additionally, this project serves as an opportunity to refresh and enhance coding skills within the SPFx ecosystem.

### Alert List Fields & Configuration:

When creating the "Alerts" list in SharePoint, you should configure the following fields:

| Field Name      | Field Type                     | Description                                        |

### Dynamic Alert Type Configuration:

Alert types can be customized dynamically using a JSON configuration property. This allows administrators to add, modify, or remove alert types without altering the codebase. The JSON structure defines the appearance and behavior of each alert type, including icons, colors, and additional styles.

**Example JSON Structure:**

```json
[
    {
       "name":"Info",
       "iconName":"Info12",
       "backgroundColor":"#389899",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":"",
       "priorityStyles": {
          "critical": "border: 2px solid #E81123;",
          "high": "border: 1px solid #EA4300;",
          "medium": "",
          "low": ""
       }
    },
    {
       "name":"Warning",
       "iconName":"ShieldAlert",
       "backgroundColor":"#f1c40f",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    },
    {
       "name":"Maintenance",
       "iconName":"CRMServices",
       "backgroundColor":"#afd6d6",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    },
    {
       "name":"Interruption",
       "iconName":"IncidentTriangle",
       "backgroundColor":"#c54644",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    }
 ]
```

### User Targeting Configuration:

Alerts can be targeted to specific users based on their properties. This allows administrators to ensure that alerts are only shown to relevant audiences.

**Example Targeting Rules JSON (for TargetingRules field):**

```json
{
  "audiences": ["HR", "Finance"],
  "operation": "anyOf"
}
```

Operations supported:
- `anyOf`: User must match any of the audiences
- `allOf`: User must match all of the audiences
- `noneOf`: User must not match any of the audiences

### Rich Media Configuration:

Alerts can include various types of rich media content for enhanced communication.

**Example Rich Media JSON (for RichMedia field):**

```json
{
  "type": "markdown",
  "content": "# Important Update\n\nPlease review the [latest guidelines](https://example.com)",
  "altText": "Important update about new guidelines"
}
```

Media types supported:
- `image`: Display an image with the alert
- `video`: Embed a video player
- `html`: Include formatted HTML content
- `markdown`: Include markdown-formatted content

### Quick Actions Configuration:

Alerts can include interactive buttons for direct user engagement.

**Example Quick Actions JSON (for QuickActions field):**

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Add to Calendar",
    "actionType": "link",
    "url": "https://example.com/calendar",
    "icon": "Calendar"
  },
  {
    "label": "Acknowledge",
    "actionType": "acknowledge",
    "icon": "CheckMark"
  }
]
```

Action types supported:
- `link`: Open a URL
- `dismiss`: Dismiss the alert
- `acknowledge`: Acknowledge and dismiss the alert
- `custom`: Execute a custom JavaScript function

## Accessibility Features

The Alert Banner is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA attributes for better screen reader integration.

- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast.
- **Text Scaling**: Supports browser text scaling for vision impairments.
- **RTL Language Support**: Right-to-left language layout support for global accessibility.

## Performance Considerations

The Alert Banner is optimized for performance:

- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses React memo and callback optimizations to reduce render cycles.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements local and session storage for efficient alert management.

- **Component Splitting**: Modular design allows for better code splitting.
- **CSS Optimization**: Carefully organized SCSS with variables for minimal CSS output.

## Current Limitations

- Translation/multi-language support is currently not implemented but is planned for a future release.
- Animations and transitions are limited for cross-browser compatibility.
- Outlook web integration is in development for a future release.
